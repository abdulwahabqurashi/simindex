In addition, most lines and trains are equipped with systems designed to intervene automatically, to stop or reduce the speed of the train, at the end point or within a safe distance thereafter (safety overlap) in the event of the train driver failing to respond correctly to the imminent end of a movement authority.  Such systems do not remove responsibility from the train driver to control the train in compliance with the limits of any movement authority, permissible line speeds, and other route and train-related constraints.\n",

When the work requires complete closure of the route, train services are either diverted to other routes or suspended.  Complete segregation is not possible for movements required in connection with the work.\n",

A vehicle with a RA number higher than that of a section of route cannot operate over that section (for example, a vehicle assessed as RA 8 cannot operate over a route assessed as RA7) unless special conditions can be applied to mitigate risks of failure of the infrastructure and derailment of the train.  \n",

The plan should enable decisions about where defective trains can be moved, for example, to allow passengers to detrain, or for repairs, to be predictable, consistent and timely.  The plan should also permit risk-based decisions to be made about retaining defective trains in service in some circumstances, when the alternatives may increase overall risks to passenger safety.  The minimum requirements for such contingency plans are defined in Railway Group Standards.\n",
