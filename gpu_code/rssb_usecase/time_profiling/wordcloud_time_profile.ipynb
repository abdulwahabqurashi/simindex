In addition, most lines and trains are equipped with systems designed to intervene automatically, to stop or reduce the speed of the train, at the end point or within a safe distance thereafter (safety overlap) in the event of the train driver failing to respond correctly to the imminent end of a movement authority.  Such systems do not remove responsibility from the train driver to control the train in compliance with the limits of any movement authority, permissible line speeds, and other route and train-related constraints.\n",

When the work requires complete closure of the route, train services are either diverted to other routes or suspended.  Complete segregation is not possible for movements required in connection with the work.\n",

A vehicle with a RA number higher than that of a section of route cannot operate over that section (for example, a vehicle assessed as RA 8 cannot operate over a route assessed as RA7) unless special conditions can be applied to mitigate risks of failure of the infrastructure and derailment of the train.  \n",

The plan should enable decisions about where defective trains can be moved, for example, to allow passengers to detrain, or for repairs, to be predictable, consistent and timely.  The plan should also permit risk-based decisions to be made about retaining defective trains in service in some circumstances, when the alternatives may increase overall risks to passenger safety.  The minimum requirements for such contingency plans are defined in Railway Group Standards.\n",

This is normally achieved and maintained by train control and signalling systems, based on one train in one section of line at a time; it applies to train movements on single, double or multiple-track lines.   \n",

In addition, most lines and trains are equipped with systems designed to intervene automatically, to stop or reduce the speed of the train, at the end point or within a safe distance thereafter (safety overlap) in the event of the train driver failing to respond correctly to the imminent end of a movement authority.  Such systems do not remove responsibility from the train driver to control the train in compliance with the limits of any movement authority, permissible line speeds, and other route and train-related constraints.   \n",

When the work requires complete closure of the route, train services are either diverted to other routes or suspended.  Complete segregation is not possible for movements required in connection with the work.   \n",

A vehicle with a RA number higher than that of a section of route cannot operate over that section (for example, a vehicle assessed as RA 8 cannot operate over a route assessed as RA7) unless special conditions can be applied to mitigate risks of failure of the infrastructure and derailment of the train.     \n",

The plan should enable decisions about where defective trains can be moved, for example, to allow passengers to detrain, or for repairs, to be predictable, consistent and timely.  The plan should also permit risk-based decisions to be made about retaining defective trains in service in some circumstances, when the alternatives may increase overall risks to passenger safety.  The minimum requirements for such contingency plans are defined in Railway Group Standards.   \n",

For each incident, the definition of each parameter depends on the importance to safe train operations of the defective system or component.     \n",

Trains on an adjacent line must be stopped.  It is usually preferable to move the vehicle and its load under special conditions to a location clear of running lines, where it can be replaced or secured correctly, or transhipped, rather than increase delay to other trains.   \n",
