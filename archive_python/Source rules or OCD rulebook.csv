2.1.3 Controls – Operations under degraded conditions
2.1.1.4 Operating procedures using written or spoken instructions are applied when the signalling system cannot be used to preserve the effectiveness of the space interval:
2.5.2.1 Trains must not be permitted to start a journey unless there is sufficient braking capacity available for the complete train.  
2.3.2 Controls – Level Crossings
2.6.1.4 The Route Availability (RA) system provides a consistent and simple method for assessing the compatibility of the weight of rail vehicles with the capacity of underline bridges (other than bridges defined as ‘long span’).
2.2.1.1 The safety benefits of a system for maintaining space intervals between trains (see section 2.1 of this operational concept document) are compromised if a train proceeds without an authority for its movement.
2.8.6 Controls – railway workforce (Communication between train drivers and signallers)
